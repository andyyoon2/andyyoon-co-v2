# Hello, Astro!

Hi, I'm Andy.

Welcome to my new blog, and yet another personal website.

I've been growing disillusioned with Next.js and React as of late. Especially Node.js and Jest. Don't get me started on Jest. Especially MUI too. The JS ecosystem and community is as vibrant as ever. Why stick to the same old, when the world is changing and our tools need to evolve with it?

Here I am, trying something new, and going with my intuition.

Have fun!
