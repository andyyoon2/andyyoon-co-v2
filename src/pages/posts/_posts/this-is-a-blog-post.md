It's not a good post. I don't expect you to read it.

Here I am to cultivate the critical practice of writing and publishing.

## Recent Insights

- Keep doing what works. Commit to those habits that maintain your foundation. For me, this looks like daily meditation and journaling time.
- Work is chaotic, and it's ramped up exponentially as our company picks up momentum. It's not easy. Yet, I realized I actually find comfort in this specific kind of chaos. Building with this team, for my company's unique position in this insane AI market, is extremely satisfying.
- My superpower is staying calm and stable in chaos—not being immovable, but going with the flow and being at peace in that upheaval.
- My style is grounded in simplicity and clarity. I have love for the small details. And I always find a way to have fun.

## Some Things I've Learned Recently

- How to efficiently create and update millions of database records with Django ORM and Postgres.
- The ETC principle: Good design is "Easier To Change".
- The DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself. This is perhaps my most often cited principle in code reviews. But my understanding has grown recently. DRY is not just about not-repeating code. It's about not duplicating _encoded knowledge_. Each piece of knowledge should be encoded into one place in the codebase. Truly illuminating!

## What I'm Thankful For

- The difficulty of my latest work project, and receiving almost exclusively negative feedback and sometimes outright hostility from my team lead. It's been great resilience training.
- The rhythms of family life at home with my fiancée, her parents, and my dog.
- The simple pleasure walking my dog, without listening to podcasts as I usually do. No distractions, just being present to the richness of the neighborhood.

I have now written a blog post. Here's one more piece of evidence that I am a writer.
