I've been hearing a theme from my coworkers lately.

> Hoping you could do this today if possible, I know how much you have on your plate so appreciate your help a lot!

> Don't worry, it's not super urgent, and I know how much you have on your plate

> Ty for circling back but I know you got a lot on your plate

> I know you have a lot on your plate, as always, but I'd like you to prioritize looking into this please. When can you take a look?

My plate is piled high of tasks, requests, others' asks. People know I'm busy.

This is not what I want to be known for!

I appreciate my teammates turning to me for help. They know I'm someone that can help them, for which I am very grateful. I've felt *helpful*, but not *useful*.

As the saying goes, "If you're busy, you're not prioritized." Here's the unsaid converse: "If you're prioritized, you won't be busy." Now, I don't know if that's true, but I'd like to approach it from that angleâ€”starting from the priorities.

The most freedom I've found in the last several months: Sitting down and deciding the highest impact things I can deliver. Communicating them as my priorities. And committing to the willingness to say no to requests outside of those tasks.

Usually I love jumping in to help, relishing every opportunity to learn and do my best. But if I'm "doing my best" in turning around unimportant asks, is that really my *best*?

Your best isn't accomplished by fulfilling others' agendas. Your best is accomplished in that which you know you must do. Even if you're not sure what that is yet, you're the only one that can explore your path.

Your next step need not align with what others want you to do. But as long as you're true to what you're doing, you'll have a chance to find those who are aligned with you. Those who want you to be you.
